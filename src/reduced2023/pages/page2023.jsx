      <h1>Welcome to the Search and Compare Tool!</h1>
      <p>
        This tool will help you figure out whether the City of Detroit is fairly
        assessing your property’s value. If your property is not being fairly
        assessed, this tool provides you with evidence that you can use to
        protest your assessment and lower your tax bill.

      <h3>How to Use This Tool</h3>
      <p>Step 1. Input your address into the search bar below.</p>
      <p>Step 2. Select your address from the list. </p>
      <p>
        Step 3. Compare the City’s estimate of your property’s MARKET VALUE to
        the SALES PRICES of homes that have recently sold in your neighborhood.
        If the market value of your property is HIGHER than the sales prices of
        similar homes, the City is over assessing your property value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4. Select the sale in your neighborhood that is most similar to
        your property. If you aren’t sure, pick the home that is closest to
        yours. Click the “Generate Appeal Evidence” button to receive the
        property sales data that you can attach as evidence to your property tax
        assessment appeal. <br></br> Tip: Make sure the property you select is
        not in much worse condition than your home. If you can, walk or drive by
        the property to check it out.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5. Submit your appeal on your own by emailing it to
        AssessorReview@detroitmi.gov no later than February 22, 2023 (make sure

      <h2>Search and Compare Tool</h2>
      <p>
        This tool finds sales of properties that are similar to yours in your
        neighborhood. The assessor refers to these sales as “Comparable
        Properties.” From these comparable property sales, you can tell what
        your property is likely worth. If the City is assessing your property as
        though it has a higher market value than these sales prices, the City is
        likely over assessing and overtaxing you.
      </p>
      <p>This tool does not file an appeal on your behalf.</p>
