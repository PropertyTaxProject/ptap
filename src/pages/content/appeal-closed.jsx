          The Institute for Law and Organizing and the Coalition for Property
          Tax Justice are nonprofit community organizations, which have
          partnered with the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law Housing
          Law Clinic to create the Detroit Property Tax Appeal Program. This
          program helps Detroit homeowners determine whether or not the City of
          Detroit has illegally inflated their property taxes. If so, we partner
          with homeowners to file a property tax assessment appeal to correct
          this, FREE OF CHARGE.
