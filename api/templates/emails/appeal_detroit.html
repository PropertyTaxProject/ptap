<p>Board of Review:</p>
<p>
  This appeal is submitted to challenge the property tax assessment for {{
  address }}.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Summary of the Argument</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The assessed value of {{ address }} (the “Property”), incorrectly determined
    by the City to be {{ target.assessed_value }}, should be no more than {{
    contention_sev }}, based on the most similar comparable property: {{
    primary.address }}.
  </li>
  <li>
    The City of Detroit incorrectly applied the cost to construct approach to
    calculate the Property&apos;s value.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Property should be treated as {{ capped_percent_good }}% good, but
        Detroit&apos;s assessor treated the Property as {{ percent_good }}%
        good.
      </li>
      <li>
        The March Board of Review should correct the City of Detroit&apos;s
        failure to follow the State Tax Commission&apos;s guidelines on
        depreciation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The assessed value of Property should be further reduced as a result of
    impairment in its utility and/or desirability caused by factors outside the
    Property&apos;s boundaries.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the relevant data on {{ owner }}'s property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Address: {{ address }}</li>
  <li>Baths: {{ target.baths }}</li>
  <li>Square Footage: {{ target.building_sq_ft }}</li>
  <li>Year Built: {{ target.year_built }}</li>
  <li>Neighborhood: {{ target.neighborhood }}</li>
  <li>Garage: {{ "Yes" if target.garage else "No" }}</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A very similar property was recently sold at {{ primary.address }} for {{
  primary_sale_price }} (the “Comparable Sale”). This Comparable Sale was marked
  as an arms-length by the Detroit Assessment Division and used in the
  City&apos;s ECF Sales Study, which looks at sales between April 1, 2023 and
  March 31, 2025.
</p>

<p>Here is the relevant data on the Comparable Sale:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Address: {{ primary.address }}</li>
  <li>Distance from home: {{ primary_distance }}</li>
  <li>Baths: {{ primary.baths }}</li>
  <li>Square Footage: {{ primary.building_sq_ft }}</li>
  <li>Year Built: {{ primary.year_built }}</li>
  <li>Neighborhood: {{ primary.neighborhood }}</li>
  <li>Garage: {{ "Yes" if primary.garage else "No" }}</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Incorrect Depreciation of {{ address }}</strong></p>
<p>
  Even if the March Board of Review (the “Board”) uses the Assessor&apos;s cost
  to construct approach to value the Property, the Board would still need to
  lower the Property&apos;s assessment. The City of Detroit has incorrectly
  depreciated {{ address }}. State law requires that the City depreciate the
  property based on the depreciation standards outlined in Volume I of the 2014
  Assessor&apos;s Manual. Property is {{ age }} years old, but the City treats
  the property as only {{ effective_age }} years old. Therefore, when
  depreciating the Property&apos;s cost to construct, the City treated the
  Property as though its remaining percent good is {{ percent_good }}%, when
  they should have treated the Property as though its remaining percent good is
  {{ capped_percent_good }}%. The City is only allowed to deviate from State
  law-mandated depreciation schedule for “exceptional maintenance, remodeling,
  replacements and additions,” including exceptionally poor maintenance. The
  Property was not improved in any way that would warrant a deviation from the
  State law-mandated depreciation schedule. As a result, the City incorrectly
  depreciated and assessed the property. Therefore, the Board should also update
  the assessment roll and the Property&apos;s record card to reflect that is has
  an effective age of {{ capped_age }}.
