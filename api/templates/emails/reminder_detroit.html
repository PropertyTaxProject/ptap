  reported that, between 2010 and 2016, the City of Detroit stole over $600
  million from its homeowners by illegally inflating its property tax
  assessments. The Detroit Mercy Law School Housing Clinic, the Institute for
  Law and Organizing, and the Coalition for Property Tax Justice are nonprofit
  organizations, fighting to ensure that the City of Detroit never again
  overcharges any of its homeowners. Because we receive grant money from
  foundations, our services are completely <strong>FREE</strong> to homeowners.

<p>
  If you are still interested in submitting an application, we kindly request
  that you finish your application. If you qualify, we will draft and file your
  appeal letter, as well as argue your appeal before the March Board of Review,
  for <strong>FREE</strong>.
