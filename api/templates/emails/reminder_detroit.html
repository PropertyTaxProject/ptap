  reported that, between 2010 and 2016, the City of Detroit stole over $600
  million from its homeowners by illegally inflating its property tax
  assessments. The Institute for Law and Organizing (“ILO”) is a nonprofit
  organization, fighting to ensure that the City of Detroit never again
  overcharges any of its homeowners. Because we receive grant money from
  foundations, our services are completely <strong>FREE</strong> to homeowners.
</p>
<p>
  If you are still interested in submitting an application, we kindly request
  that you complete the Representation Agreement and finish your application. If
  you qualify, ILO will draft and file your appeal letter, as well as argue your
  appeal before the March Board of Review, for <strong>FREE</strong>.
