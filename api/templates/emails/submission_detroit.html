<p>Hi {{ owner }},</p>
<p>
  Thank you for creating and submitting your property tax appeal letter for {{
  address }} through our self-help application.
</p>
<p>
  Your appeal letter has been submitted to the March Board of Review. You were
  copied on the email submitting your appeal. There is nothing more you need to
  do.

      >Be on the lookout for a notice from the City of Detroit with the date,
      time, and location of your hearing. We are not your representative and are
      not responsible for notifying you of the details of your hearing.</u

  Additionally, if your income qualifies you for the Homeowners Property
  Exemption (HOPE), please reach out to Wayne Metro to complete a HOPE
  application. Receiving HOPE will likely result in more property tax savings
  than this appeal. Contact Wayne Metro at (866) 313-2520 or schedule an
  appointment with Wayne Metro here:
  https://detroithousingnetwork.my.site.com/DetroitHOPE/s/.
</p>
<p>
  You might qualify for HOPE if your income is at or less than the following:
