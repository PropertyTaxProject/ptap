<p>Hi {{ name }},</p>
<p>
  Thank you for completing the Property Tax Appeal Project application for
  services for {{ address }}. {% if not has_images %} We noticed you have not
  uploaded any photos of interior or exterior damage to your home. While our
  application does not require photos, they can increase the likelihood that the
  City of Detroit will lower your property taxes by showing that the City&apos;s
  current property tax assessment is not taking into account this damage.
</p>
<p>
  If you have photos you would like to add, simply email them to
  ptap@lawandorganizing.org. If you need assistance sending pictures to us, book
  an appointment with one of our community advocates here:
  <a href="https://calendly.com/d/cmr7-z3h-fn8/property-tax-appeal-assistance"
    >Schedule an appointment</a
  >. {% else %} There is nothing more you need to do for the moment. Our team is
  working hard to carefully process your application and analyze the fairness of
  your current property tax assessment. We will reach out to you in the coming
  weeks with next steps. If you have any pressing questions, however, you can
  sign up for an appointment here:
  <a href="https://calendly.com/d/cmr7-z3h-fn8/property-tax-appeal-assistance"
    >Schedule an appointment</a
  >.{% endif %}
</p>
<p>What to expect next</p>
<p>
  Our team will contact you before our March 5th deadline. {% if has_images %}
  In the meantime, if you have any questions, you can send us an email at:
