<p>Dear {{ name }},</p>
<p>
  The Property Tax Appeal Project&apos;s records show that you have received the
  Homeowners Property Exemption (HOPE), Poverty Tax Exemption (PTE), or another
  hardship program within the last three years.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of filing an appeal, the Institute for Law and Organizing (“ILO”)
  would like to direct you to the following link to connect with our partners at
  Wayne Metro:
  <a href="https://actionnetwork.timetap.com/#/">Schedule a HOPE appointment</a
  >. After scheduling an appointment, Wayne Metro will help you complete a HOPE
  application.
</p>
<p>
  If you are no longer eligible for HOPE, please schedule an appointment with
  ILO, so that our team can assist you in completing a property tax appeal
  application:
  <a href="https://calendly.com/d/3gr-nwc-zfx/property-tax-appeal-support-call"
    >Schedule a property tax appeal appointment</a
  >.
</p>
<br />
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The Property Tax Appeal Project Automated System</p>
